# CatFacts
A learning repository to create an android application to display random cat facts.

# The Task
Using the cat facts free API (https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts), create a compose android 
application that displays a random cat fact.

You have a good selection of libraries at your disposal, all of which are the same that is used in the GOL Android application.

- Utilise OkHTTP and Retrofit to make your network calls.
- Use coroutines and flows to asynchronously call endpoints and return data
- Use compose to render the UI

Happy Coding!
